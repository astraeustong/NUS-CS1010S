Tamagotchi
A tamagotchi is a virtual pet. Write a class Tamagotchi that creates a Tamagotchi object with the specified name. You should decide what properties the Tamagotchi object should have in order to support the required behaviour as elaborated below. A Tamagotchi object, t has three methods:

- teach where there can be a variable number of string inputs. This teaches the tamagotchi these words. Symbols will also work. If you try to teach a tamagotchi the same words more than once, it will ignore the later attempts.

- play will make the tamagotchi return a stringified list of words that it has been taught (in sequential order).

- kill will kill the tamagotchi. Once a tamagotchi is in heaven, it cannot be taught and will not respond when you try to play with it. Instead, all further method calls will return the string "<name> is dead" where <name> is the name of the tamagotchi.
